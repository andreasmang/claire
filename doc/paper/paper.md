# Summary
[`CLAIRE`](https://andreasmang.github.io/claire) [@claire-web] is a computational framework for **C**onstrained **LA**rge deformation diffeomorphic **I**mage **RE**gistration [@Mang:2019a]. It supports highly-optimized, parallel computational kernels for (multi-node) CPU [@Mang:2016a],[@Gholami:2017a],[@Mang:2019a] and (multi-node multi-)GPU architectures [@Brunn:2020a],[@Brunn:2021a]. `CLAIRE` uses MPI for distributed-memory parallelism and can be scaled up to thousands of cores [@Mang:2019a,@Mang:2016a] and GPU devices [@Brunn:2020a]. The multi-GPU implementation exploiting device direct communication. The computational kernels are interpolation for semi-Lagrangian time integration, and a mixture of high-order finite difference operators and Fast-Fourier-Transforms (FFTs) for differentiation. `CLAIRE` uses a Newton--Krylov solver for numerical optimization [@Mang:2015a],[@Mang:2017a]. It features various schemes for regularization of the control problem [@Mang:2016a] and different similarity measures. `CLAIRE` features different preconditioners for the reduced space Hessian [@Brunn:2020a],[@Mang:2019a] to optimize computational throughput and enable fast convergence. It uses `PETSc` [@petsc-web] for scalable and efficient linear algebra operations and solvers and `TAO` [@petsc-web],[@Munson:2015a] for numerical optimization. `CLAIRE` can be downloaded at <https://github.com/andreasmang/claire>.

# Statement of Need
Image registration is required whenever images are taken at different points in time, from different viewpoints, and/or using different imaging modalities and these images need to be compared, combined, or integrated [@Fischer:2008a],[@Modersitzki:2004a],[@Modersitzki:2009a],[@Sotiras:2013a]. Image registration is an inverse problem. The inputs to this inverse problem are two (or more) images $m_0(x)$ (the template image) and $m_1(x)$ (the reference image) of the same object. The task of image registration is to find a plausible map $y(x)$ that establishes spatial correspondences between the reference and template image, i.e., $m_0(x) \approx m_1(y(x))$. In `CLAIRE` the set of admissible spatial transformations $y$ is limited to diffeomorphisms, i.e., maps $y$ that are continuous, one-to-one, and have a smooth inverse. `CLAIRE` is related to a prominent class of formulations for these types of problems referred to as <em>large-deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping</em> [@Beg:2005a],[@Trouve:1998a],[@Younes:2010a].

Diffeomorphic image registration is an indispensable tool in medical image analysis [@Sotiras:2013a]. Computing diffeomorphisms that map one image to another is expensive. Deformable image registration is an infinite-dimensional problem that upon discretization leads to nonlinear optimality systems with millions or even billions of unknowns. For example, registering two typical medical imaging datasets of size $256^3$ necessitates solving for about 50 million unknowns. Additional complications are the ill-posedness and non-linearty of this inverse problem [@Fischer:2008a]. Consequently, image registration can take several minutes on multi-core high-end CPUs. Many of the available methods reduce the number of unknowns by using coarser resolutions either through parameterization or by solving the problem on coarser grids; they use simplified algorithms and deliver subpar registration quality. In the age of big data, clinical population studies that require thousands of registrations are incresingly common, and execution times of individual registrations become more critical. We provide technology that allows solving registration problems for clinical datasets in seconds. In addition, we have made available to the public a software that works on multi-node, multi-GPU architectures [@Brunn:2020a],[@Brunn:2021a] that allows the registration of large-scale microscopic imaging data such as CLARITY imaging [@Tomer:2014a],[@Kutten:2017a].

# Highlights
`CLAIRE` can be used to register images of $2048^3$ (25 B unknowns) on 64 nodes with 256 GPUs on TACC’s Longhorn system [@Brunn:2020a]. `CLAIRE` has been used for the registration of high resolution CLARITY imaging data [@Brunn:2020a]. The GPU version of `CLAIRE` can solve clinically relevant problem sizes (50 M unknowns) in approximately 5 seconds on a single NVIDIA Tesla V100 [@Brunn:2020a]. `CLAIRE` has also been applied to hundreds of images in brain tumor imaging studies [@Mang:2017c],[@Scheufele:2021a], and integrated with models for biophysics inversion [@Mang:2018a],[@Mang:2020a],[@Scheufele:2020a],[@Scheufele:2019a],[@Scheufele:2021a],[@Subramanian:2020b] and Alzheimer's disease progression [@Scheufele:2020c]. `CLAIRE` uses highly optimized computational kernels and effective, state-of-the-art algorithms for time integration and numerical optimization. Our most recent version of `CLAIRE` features a Python interface to assist users in their applications.

We provide a detailed documentation on how to execute, compile, and install `CLAIRE` on various systems at our deployment page <https://andreasmang.github.io/claire>.

# Mathematics
`CLAIRE` uses an optimal control formulation. The diffeomorphism $y(x)$ is parameterized using a smooth, stationary velocity field $v(x)$. Given the template image $m_0(x)$ and the reference image $m_1(x)$, this velocity is found by solving the partial-differential equation constrained optimization problem of the form
$$
\operatorname{minimize}_{v,m} \operatorname{dist}(m(x,t=1),m_1) + \alpha\operatorname{reg}(v)
$$

subject to
$$
\begin{aligned}
\partial_t  m(x,t) + v(x) \cdot \nabla m(x,t) &= 0 \\
m(x,t=0) & = m_0(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

The first term in the objective functional measures the proximity of the deformed template image $m(x,t=1)$ and the reference image $m_1(x)$. The default option availble in `CLAIRE` is an $L^2$-distance. The second term controls the regularity of $v$. `CLAIRE` features different Sobolev norms. The default option is an $H^1$-seminorm. The constraint models the deformation the template image (i.e., the transport of the intensities $m(x,t)$ of $m_0(x)$). `CLAIRE` also features additional hard constraints for controlling the divergence of $v(x)$ [@Mang:2016a]. For optimization, we introduce a Lagrangian and solve the associated Karush--Kuhn--Tucker optimality system using a Newton--Krylov reduced space method [@Mang:2015a],[@Mang:2015a].
