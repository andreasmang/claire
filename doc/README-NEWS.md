Go back to [README.md](../README.md).

* 03/2021 We have renamed the `master` branch to `cpu` (the legacy CPU implementation of CLAIRE)
* 28/2020 We have released a GPU version of CLAIRE. If you are interested in using our new (multi-node multi-)GPU version, switch to the **GPU branch**. If you are interested in learning more about the GPU version of CLAIRE, check out our [publications](doc/README-REFERENCES.md).
* 11/2018 Support for Normalized-Cross-Correlation (NCC) has been added to CLAIRE.
